### Ciphar100---multiclass-classification-of-images
INTRODUCTION:
In this assignment we practiced Deep Learning CNN on CIFAR-100 dataset,
Which consist 60k images classified exclusively into 100 classes. In this project we tested 3 different models, all three of them are Deep CNN models. The first model is a CNN model we build from scratch, the second model is a pretty similar model but with some improvements on the first model and the third model is a model we took from keras library with ImageNet weights.
In each model we demonstrated a confusion matrix to show the model results.

Data Description:

The CIFAR-100 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 color images in 100 different classes,
With 600 images per class. The dataset consists of 50000 training samples and 10000 testing samples, with 500 images per class for the training samples and 100 images per class for the testing samples.
